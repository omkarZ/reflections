1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
>>> Git won't track any files by itself and won't make a first commit either. I might use it to start version controlling of an existing project or a new project.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
>>> It provides me the flexiblity to choose which files will be commited next. Git is tracking the files in the staging area, not necesarrily all the files in the working directory, i might be wrong.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
>>> I'll only add those files to the staging area which I've changed. I don't know man

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
>>> I can try out an experimental feature without making it an official release or part of the master. (Development branch, production branch, context switch)

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
>>> They help with reachability and knowing which commits are parents of which branch.
